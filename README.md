## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned that you can actually have 2 values for the background-image property.

### Continued development

- Based from this challenge, I'm hoping to get better at the background image part since I find it tough to get them in its proper place in terms of responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [@VitorBomaro](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/sass-and-flexbox-mCPOL6w9M) - I knew about the 2 values in the background-image property from this person's code.
